## Current Priority

- **Transcendental and `**` policy**: ECMA leaves them implementation-approximated, so their endpoint hulls rest on a host-libm monotonicity assumption (and the checker runs JSC while checked code may run V8). Decide whether to keep the assumption documented, widen hulls by an ulp, or drop the hulls.
